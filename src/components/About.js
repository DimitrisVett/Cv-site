      About

    I speak Javascript, with a React accent (currently experimenED speaking Vue). Currently at Junior stage, 
    I aim to work on Front End apps with a team that would allow me to collaborate and own projects (eventually) at the same time. 
    Being very well versed in Back End apps (Node. JS user) gives me a slight edge in quickly identifying any mistakes in code between Front and Back End.
    Please check my GitHub on the Contact element on the CV,  to check out my code writing standards.
    Working with Nerdgeschoss and developing within the type of team you describe in your site sharing these specific values, seems idyllic. 
    Diversity and Collaboration are my top personal values and I would love nothing more than being able to live them at work out.</p>
