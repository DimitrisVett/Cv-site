    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
    I am a programming Jedi in the making. I wish nothing more than you to become my Yoda (s).
    Not much to say about my past work experience I am afraid, but a LOT to expect in my future one.  
    Why is that?
    <ul>
     <li>Because I learn & implement extremely fast</li>
     <li>I focus to death (although at times not for too long),</li>
     <li>I am obsessed with UX and UI (blame aesthetics & functionality) and ...</li>
     <li>Because the reason I code is to experience these EUREKA! moments as much as I can through problem solving</li>
    </ul>
